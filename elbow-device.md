# Soft Robotics Elbow Device #

### by Michael ###

My work is about making an arm thing. My hope is to make my arm thing better than other people's arm things. Mine should be better, faster, stronger. Other arm things can be bad because they are feared since they could hurt. Mine should be soft and less feared. If it is good enough it could be used in hospitals for people with sick arm or brains. They could then become less sick.
