# Space in the hospital for everyone #

### by Dimitra ###

Sometimes, people don't feel well and they make other people not feel well. Then more and more people feel bad. They go to the hospital to get better. If too many people feel bad, there is not enough space in the hospital. I use computers to guess how many people will start feeling bad in the next few days to make sure there is enough space in the hospital so they can all get better.
